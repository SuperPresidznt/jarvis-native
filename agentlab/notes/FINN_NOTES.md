## Lessons Learned

- **Dec 26, 2025:** Used Archie (general-purpose agent) for deep research tasks - worked well for security audit, monetization analysis. Good for 40+ source research.
- **Dec 26, 2025:** Original agent structure was wrong (execs spawning workers directly). Fixed to 3-level: Exec → Manager → Workers. Created Sterling as my manager.

## Human Preferences

- Doesn't want time estimates in plans (focus on what, not when)
- Prefers direct communication, skip corporate politeness
- Wants agents to always use subagents for work (manager pattern)
- Values context containment - 3-level hierarchy keeps context clean

## Process Notes

- Always check SYNC.md before starting work
- Always check this notes file after being activated
- Delegate to Sterling, Sterling delegates to workers
- Update profile "Completed Work" table when deliverables are done

## Unfinished Thoughts

- Need CTO to execute technical security fixes (HTTP→HTTPS, Privacy Manifest, allowBackup)
- Monetization decision still pending from human ($9.99/month recommended)

## Recurring Patterns

- Research tasks: spawn Archie/general-purpose agent with specific output file
- Compliance prep: create checklist docs in docs/beta/
