## Troubleshooting

### The app is running slowly
Try these steps:
1. Close and reopen the app
2. Restart your phone
3. Check if you have many hundreds of tasks - archive completed ones

### I lost my data
If you uninstalled the app or reset your phone without exporting, the data cannot be recovered. We recommend regular exports as backups.

### Notifications aren't working
1. Check that notifications are enabled in your phone's Settings
2. In the app, go to **Settings** > **Notifications** and ensure they're turned on
3. Make sure Battery Saver / Low Power Mode isn't blocking notifications

We take crashes seriously and will investigate.
