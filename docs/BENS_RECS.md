## TIER 1 - Quick Wins (1-3 days each, high impact)

| Idea | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Top 3 habits at top** | 2hr | High | Easy sort, great UX |
| **Focus timer options (1m, 2m, 10m)** | 2hr | Medium | Just add presets |
| **Tap transaction for details** | 4hr | High | Already have modal pattern |
| **Calendar tap to journal/notes** | 1 day | High | Great feature, links calendar to notes |
| **RGB picker for themes** | 1 day | Medium | Fun, users love customization |

## TIER 2 - Medium Effort (1-2 weeks each)

| Idea | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Goals section with progress bars** | 1 week | High | Different from projects, sub-goals |
| **Simple vs Complex mode** | 1 week | High | Toggle hides advanced features |
| **Receipt photos on transactions** | 1 week | Medium | Camera + storage needed |
| **AI voice input** | 1 week | High | expo-speech already installed |
| **Reminders page + between-schedule** | 1 week | Medium | Notification system exists |
| **Easter eggs / funny mode** | 3 days | Medium | N64 sound = cult classic, great branding |

## TIER 3 - Larger Features (2-4 weeks each)

| Idea | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Theme store / premium themes** | 2 weeks | Medium | Monetization opportunity |
| **Floating nav circle (custom nav)** | 2 weeks | High | Unique UX, needs prototyping |
| **Voice memo + picture capture** | 2 weeks | Medium | Multimedia notes |
| **Location-based reminders** | 2 weeks | Medium | Needs location permissions |
| **Balance notifications** | 3 days | Medium | Push notification on threshold |

## TIER 4 - Major Integrations (1-3 months)

| Idea | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Plaid integration** | 1 month | High | $$ for Plaid API, but auto-import is killer feature |
| **Syncing feature (cloud)** | 1 month | High | Needs backend, auth, conflict resolution |
| **Watch/step tracker API** | 2 weeks | Medium | HealthKit (iOS) / Google Fit (Android) |
| **AI asset price updates** | 2 weeks | Medium | Zillow/KBB APIs, some are paid |
| **PC app** | 2-3 months | Medium | Electron or web app, shared DB |

## IMPOSSIBLE? None.

All ideas are technically feasible. Some are just more complex:
- **Plaid** = paid API ($300-500/mo at scale) but doable
- **PC app** = significant effort but not impossible
- **Location reminders** = battery concerns, but standard feature

## VERDICT

**Best ROI ideas to do first:**
1. Top 3 habits at top (2hr, instant UX win)
2. Focus timer presets (2hr, easy)
3. Calendar → journal link (1 day, high value)
4. Goals section with progress bars (1 week, differentiator)
5. Easter eggs (3 days, memorable branding)

**Skip for now:**
- PC app (too much effort for beta)
- Plaid (wait until revenue to justify cost)
