## 1. Pre-Launch Preparation

### Timeline: 2-3 Months Before Launch

**Month 1-2: Community Building**

- Create your ProductHunt profile immediately. Add photo, bio, website links, and social accounts.
- Engage with the PH community authentically - upvote products you genuinely like, leave thoughtful comments, participate in discussions.
- Build relationships with active hunters and makers. Follow people, respond to their content, be genuinely helpful.
- Join relevant communities beyond PH: Indie Hackers, Twitter, LinkedIn groups, Reddit (r/productivity, r/SideProject).
- Share your building journey publicly. Post updates on Twitter, grow your personal brand.
- CRITICAL: Don't just show up on launch day. The community values authenticity and will detect if you're only there to promote yourself.

**6-8 Weeks Before: Create Coming Soon Page**

- Set up a Coming Soon page on ProductHunt (if it's your first launch).
- Share the Coming Soon page across your networks to build your follower count.
- Collect emails from interested supporters who want to be notified when you launch.

**4 Weeks Before: Asset Creation**

- Screenshot design and story flow (4-8 images)
- Product demo video or GIF
- Thumbnail/logo animation (optional but eye-catching)
- Product tagline (one-sentence value prop)
- Product description (detailed but scannable)
- Maker comment draft
- Social media templates (Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, email)
- Landing page specific to PH traffic (with conversion tracking)

**2 Weeks Before: Supporter Outreach**

- Create a spreadsheet of potential supporters:
  - Beta users who love the product
  - People you've helped in communities
  - Fellow makers you've supported
  - Friends/family who understand the product
  - Industry contacts and influencers
- Reach out personally (NOT mass emails) to let them know about your upcoming launch.
- Ask if they'd be interested in checking it out - DON'T ask for upvotes directly.
- Mark who responds positively in your spreadsheet.

**1 Week Before: Final Prep**

- Schedule your launch for exactly 12:01 AM PST on your chosen day.
- Prepare all marketing materials with final links.
- Test your product thoroughly - ensure zero critical bugs.
- Set up analytics tracking for PH traffic.
- Prepare hour-by-hour launch day schedule.
- Brief any team members on their roles (even if it's just you, plan your day).
- Get plenty of sleep the night before - launch day is exhausting.

### Solo Developer Pro Tips

- You can't be everywhere at once. Prioritize:
  1. Responding to PH comments (most important)
  2. Sharing on your own social channels
  3. Personal outreach to supporters
- Prepare canned responses for common questions to save time.
- Use scheduling tools for social media posts throughout the day.
- Block your entire launch day calendar - you'll be glued to your screen.

## 2. Optimal Launch Timing

### Best Day to Launch

**Weekdays (Tuesday-Thursday): Best for Maximum Visibility**

- Highest traffic and engagement from the PH community.
- More competitive - you'll face launches from established companies.
- Best if you have a strong support network and high-quality product.

**Weekends (Saturday-Sunday): Best for Standing Out**

- 15% more "Visit" button clicks than weekdays.
- Less competition from big tech launches.
- Perfect for indie makers, side projects, and solo developers.
- Lower overall traffic but higher conversion rates.
- Easier to reach top 5 with fewer upvotes needed.

**Avoid:**
- Mondays (people catching up from weekend)
- Fridays (people mentally checking out)
- Major holidays
- Days with known major product launches (Apple events, etc.)

### Best Time to Launch

**12:01 AM - 12:10 AM Pacific Time (OPTIMAL)**

- ProductHunt resets daily at midnight PST.
- Maximum time to collect upvotes before rankings finalize.
- Captures global audience across all time zones.
- Shows commitment and preparation (you're up at midnight).

**Alternative Times:**
- 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST: Captures mid-day US traffic
- 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST: Catches end-of-workday browsers

**Why Timing Matters:**

ProductHunt operates on a 24-hour leaderboard. The earlier you launch, the more time you have to accumulate engagement. A product launched at 12:01 AM has 24 full hours to gather upvotes, while one launched at 6:00 PM only has 6 hours.

### Solo Developer Recommendation

**Launch on a Weekend at 12:01 AM PST.**

Reasoning:
- Less competition means you can reach top 5 with ~150-300 upvotes instead of 500+.
- As a solo dev, you can't compete with VC-backed teams who have entire marketing departments.
- Weekend users are more relaxed, more likely to engage deeply with your product.
- You'll have time to respond to every comment personally.

## 3. Hunter Strategy

### Self-Hunt vs. Finding a Hunter

**Key Statistic:**
- 79% of featured posts were self-hunted by makers.
- 60% of #1 Product of the Day winners were self-hunted.

**ProductHunt's Official Recommendation:**
"Spending lots of time 'finding a hunter' is a distraction. You know your product better than anyone else, and it makes very little difference who hunts the product and how well it performs overall."

### When to Self-Hunt

Self-hunt if:
- You have an existing audience (even small - 200+ Twitter followers).
- You've been active on PH for 2+ months.
- You have beta users or supporters you can mobilize.
- You want full control of your narrative and timing.
- You're comfortable being the face of your product.

**Advantages:**
- You can respond to questions immediately with deep product knowledge.
- No coordination needed - you control the exact launch moment.
- Shows confidence and ownership.
- Community respects makers who launch themselves.

### When to Find a Hunter

Find a hunter if:
- You're completely new to ProductHunt with zero followers.
- You have zero social media presence or audience.
- You're extremely introverted and want someone else to be the spokesperson.
- You have a personal connection to a well-known hunter who genuinely loves your product.

**Advantages:**
- Hunter's followers get notified of the launch (initial boost).
- Experienced hunters know best practices and can guide you.
- Adds social proof if the hunter is respected in your niche.

### How to Find a Hunter (If Needed)

**DO:**
- Look for hunters who have launched products in your category (productivity, privacy, etc.).
- Check their profile - do they actively engage with the community?
- Reach out 2-4 weeks before launch with a personal message:
  - Introduce yourself briefly.
  - Share why you think they'd be interested in your product.
  - Ask if they'd be willing to try the product first.
  - If they like it, ask if they'd consider hunting it.
- Build a genuine relationship - comment on their launches, offer help.

**DON'T:**
- Cold message 50 hunters the week before launch.
- Pay anyone to hunt your product (violates PH rules).
- Use a hunter just for their follower count if they don't understand your product.
- Expect a hunter to do your marketing work for you.

**Where to Find Hunters:**
- ProductHunt's "Top Hunters" leaderboard
- Launchpedia's list of 100+ PH hunters
- Search for hunters who've launched similar products
- Ask in PH discussion forums

### Solo Developer Recommendation

**Self-hunt your product.**

Reasoning:
- You've spent 2+ months engaging with the PH community (per timeline above).
- You have beta users and Twitter followers who can support you.
- You know your product better than anyone - your authentic passion will resonate.
- Finding a hunter takes significant time with minimal ROI (data shows self-hunting works).
- You want to build YOUR personal brand as a maker.

## 4. Building a Supporter Base

### What's Allowed vs. What's Against the Rules

**ProductHunt's Official Rules:**

PROHIBITED (Will Get You Penalized or Delisted):
- Asking for upvotes directly ("Please upvote my product!")
- Mass messaging users asking for upvotes
- Using bots or automation to increase activity
- Incentivizing upvotes (discounts, prizes, payments for upvotes)
- Buying upvotes from third-party services
- Creating fake accounts to upvote your product
- Vote-swapping rings ("I'll upvote yours if you upvote mine")
- Bringing in brand new accounts just to upvote (algorithm detects this)

ALLOWED (Ethical Support Building):
- Sharing your launch link on social media
- Emailing your existing users/subscribers about the launch
- Posting in relevant communities (Indie Hackers, Reddit, Slack groups)
- Asking people to "check out" your launch (not explicitly "upvote")
- Encouraging genuine discussion and feedback
- Building relationships with the PH community before launch

**Key Quote:**
"Please don't. People should upvote things they genuinely like or find interesting, not because they were peer pressured to do so."

### How to Ethically Build Support

**2-3 Months Before Launch:**

1. **Engage Authentically on ProductHunt**
   - Upvote products you genuinely find interesting.
   - Leave thoughtful, helpful comments (not just "congrats!").
   - Participate in discussions and answer questions.
   - Support other indie makers' launches.
   - Build karma and reputation naturally.

2. **Build Your Audience Outside PH**
   - Twitter: Share your building journey, post progress updates, engage with tech community.
   - Indie Hackers: Share milestones, ask for feedback, be helpful to others.
   - Reddit: Participate in r/productivity, r/SideProject (authentic participation, not spam).
   - LinkedIn: Share professional insights about your industry/problem space.
   - Email list: Collect emails from beta users, early access sign-ups.

3. **Create a Beta Community**
   - Invite 20-50 people to test your product early.
   - Ask for genuine feedback and implement it.
   - These users will naturally want to support you on launch day.
   - They're invested in your success because they helped shape the product.

**2-4 Weeks Before Launch:**

1. **Personal Outreach (Not Mass Messaging)**
   - Create a list of people who've shown interest in your product.
   - Send PERSONAL messages (not templates) to:
     - Beta users who actively engaged.
     - People who asked to be notified.
     - Fellow makers you've supported.
     - Friends/family who understand the product.
   - Message template approach:
     ```
     Hey [Name],

     I'm launching [Product] on ProductHunt on [Date]. I'd love for you to check it out and share your honest thoughts in the comments. I remember you mentioned [specific feedback they gave], which really helped shape [feature].

     No pressure at all - just wanted to give you a heads up since you were part of the journey.

     Thanks!
     [Your name]
     ```
   - Mark who responds positively - these are your day-of supporters.

2. **Community Engagement**
   - Post in relevant Slack/Discord communities: "Launching on PH next week, would love your feedback."
   - Share on Twitter: "Excited to launch on ProductHunt on [date]! Been working on this for [time]. Here's what it does..."
   - Don't ask for upvotes - ask for genuine feedback and discussion.

**1 Week Before:**

1. **Create a Coming Soon Page** (if available)
   - Share it to build your follower count on PH.
   - More followers = more people notified when you launch.

2. **Final Reminder to Your List**
   - Email your subscribers: "Launching on PH on [date], would love your thoughts!"
   - Tweet a final reminder.
   - Post in communities one last time.

### Launch Day Mobilization

**How to Ask for Support (Ethically):**

DO SAY:
- "We're live on ProductHunt today! Would love your honest feedback."
- "Just launched on PH - check it out and let me know what you think!"
- "Live on ProductHunt! Any questions about [product]? I'm here all day."
- "Launching on ProductHunt today. If you find it interesting, I'd appreciate you joining the discussion."

DON'T SAY:
- "Please upvote my ProductHunt launch!"
- "Can you upvote my product? I'll upvote yours."
- "Help me get to #1 - go upvote now!"
- "I need 100 upvotes to win - please help!"

**Where to Share:**
- Your email list (personal email, not promotional blast)
- Twitter/X (multiple tweets throughout the day)
- LinkedIn (one well-crafted post)
- Relevant Slack/Discord communities (where you're an active member)
- Indie Hackers (one post with discussion)
- Reddit (ONLY if genuinely relevant and you follow community rules)
- Personal network (DMs to people who've shown interest)

**Timing Your Mobilization:**

- 12:01 AM PST: Launch goes live, share to night owls and international audience.
- 6:00 AM PST: Share to early risers, East Coast US waking up.
- 9:00 AM PST: Send email to your list, post on LinkedIn.
- 12:00 PM PST: Mid-day Twitter push, share in communities.
- 3:00 PM PST: Afternoon reminder, share any traction/feedback you've gotten.
- 6:00 PM PST: Final evening push for late-day browsers.

### Quality Over Quantity

**Important Note:**
Upvotes from new accounts or low-engagement users carry LESS weight and may even trigger spam detection. Focus on:
- Upvotes from established PH community members (high karma).
- Genuine engagement (comments, questions, discussions).
- People who actually visit your product page and spend time there.

One thoughtful comment from an engaged user is worth more than 10 upvotes from fake accounts.

### Solo Developer Reality Check

You likely won't get 500+ upvotes unless you have a massive existing audience. That's okay!

**Realistic Goals for Solo Developers:**
- 100-150 upvotes: Likely to hit front page, possible top 10.
- 150-300 upvotes: Strong chance of top 5, especially on weekends.
- 300+ upvotes: Top 3 territory, Product of the Day possible.

Success isn't just about ranking - it's about:
- Getting genuine feedback from your target audience.
- Acquiring users who actually use your product.
- Building relationships in the community.
- Validating product-market fit.

**12:00 AM (Next Day):**
- Launch day is over. Congrats - you made it!
- Respond to any final comments that came in.
- Do NOT stay up all night obsessing - get sleep.
- Tomorrow you'll start post-launch follow-up.

### Solo Developer Survival Tips

**Energy Management:**
- Launch day is a marathon, not a sprint.
- Coffee is your friend, but don't overdo it (you'll crash).
- Set 30-minute breaks every 4 hours to walk, eat, stretch.
- Have pre-written response templates for common questions.
- Use text expanders for frequently typed phrases.

**Mental Game:**
- You will NOT be #1 Product of the Day (probably). That's okay!
- Compare yourself to other solo indie launches, not VC-backed teams.
- Focus on quality conversations, not just upvote count.
- Every piece of feedback is valuable - you're learning about your users.
- Ranking is ego; user acquisition and validation are what matter.

**Response Strategy:**

Prioritize comments in this order:
1. **Questions about the product** (answer immediately, these drive engagement).
2. **Genuine feedback/suggestions** (thank them, discuss thoughtfully).
3. **Users sharing use cases** (amplify these! Screenshot and share).
4. **Simple "congrats" comments** (heart/upvote, brief thank you).

**Template Responses:**

For "Congrats!":
> "Thanks so much! Let me know if you have any questions about [product]."

For "Looks interesting, will try it":
> "Awesome! Would love to hear your thoughts after you give it a spin. Feel free to DM me with any feedback."

For Questions:
> [Give detailed, helpful answer] + "Great question! [Answer]. Let me know if you have any other questions."

For Feature Requests:
> "This is great feedback! We've heard this from a few others too. Mind if I follow up with you as we explore this? [Optional: Here's why we haven't built it yet / here's our thinking]."

For Critical Feedback:
> "Really appreciate the honest feedback. You're right that [acknowledge their point]. Here's what we're thinking: [explain]. Would love to continue this conversation - can I DM you?"

### Staying on the Front Page

**What Drives Rankings:**
- Early upvote velocity (first 3 hours matter most).
- Sustained engagement throughout the day.
- Quality of upvoters (high-karma users count more).
- Comment volume and discussion depth.
- Time spent on your product page.
- Click-through rate to your website.

**How to Maintain Momentum:**

1. **Keep Commenting:** Every time you respond to a comment, your product gets a micro-boost in the algorithm. Respond to EVERYTHING.

2. **Drive Discussion:** Ask questions in your responses to keep conversations going.
   - "What's your current workflow for [problem]?"
   - "Would you prefer [option A] or [option B]?"
   - "What's the first thing you'd want to try in the app?"

3. **Share Milestones:** When you hit #10, #5, etc., share on social media. This drives new visitors.

4. **Update Your Maker Comment:** Add an edit mid-day with any big wins or common questions:
   - "EDIT 2:00 PM: Wow! Thanks for all the support. Common question: Yes, we have [feature]. Also, for launch day we're offering [discount code]."

5. **Cross-Promote:** Comment on other launches (genuine engagement, not spam). Makers often check out your product when you engage with theirs.

6. **Use Your Network Strategically:** Don't blast everyone at once. Stagger your outreach throughout the day to maintain steady upvote flow.

### If Things Aren't Going Well

**You're Not on Front Page After 3 Hours:**
- Don't panic. Share more aggressively on social media.
- Reach out to supporters you haven't contacted yet.
- Check if you're in a trending topic - sometimes that drives more traffic than front page.
- Focus on quality engagement - a great discussion can still attract users even without top ranking.

**Low Comment Volume:**
- Ask questions in your maker comment to spark discussion.
- Respond to other launches and engage genuinely - karma helps.
- Share interesting aspects of your product on Twitter and ask for thoughts.

**Getting Negative Feedback:**
- Stay calm and professional. Thank them for the feedback.
- Acknowledge legitimate issues. Don't make excuses.
- Share your plan to address it if possible.
- Negative feedback handled well can become positive sentiment.

## 6. Maker Comments

### When to Post Your Maker Comment

**Immediately after launching - within the first 5 minutes.**

A launch without a maker comment feels incomplete and unprofessional. Users will wonder if you're engaged or just dropped the product and left.

### Structure of a High-Performing Maker Comment

**Opening: The Hook (1-2 sentences)**
- Why did you build this?
- What problem were you frustrated with?

Example:
> "Hey ProductHunt! I'm [Name], the maker of [Product]. I built this because I was tired of [specific pain point]. As someone who [your background], I couldn't find a tool that [specific need]."

**Middle: The Solution (3-5 bullet points)**
- What does your product do?
- What are the key features/benefits?
- What makes it different?

Use bullet points for scannability:
> **What [Product] does:**
> - [Key feature 1] - [benefit]
> - [Key feature 2] - [benefit]
> - [Key feature 3] - [benefit]
>
> **Why it's different:**
> - [Privacy-first / No tracking / Your unique angle]
> - [Another differentiator]

**Closing: The Ask (2-3 sentences)**
- What kind of feedback are you looking for?
- Any special offer for PH community?
- Thank the community.

Example:
> I'd love to hear your honest feedback - what features would make this more useful for you? For ProductHunt supporters, use code **PRODUCTHUNT** for 50% off your first month.
>
> Thanks for checking it out!

### Best Practices for Maker Comments

**DO:**
- Write it in advance, paste it immediately after launch.
- Use formatting: bold, bullet points, white space.
- Keep it conversational and human, not corporate.
- Show personality - this is YOUR product, be proud!
- Include a discount code or special offer for PH community.
- Ask specific questions to drive discussion.
- Mention your background/credibility briefly if relevant.
- Add social proof if you have it (beta users, existing users, etc.).

**DON'T:**
- Write a wall of text - people won't read it.
- Be overly salesy or promotional.
- Use jargon or technical terms unless your audience is technical.
- Write it at 12:01 AM when you're tired - prepare it in advance!
- Forget to include a call-to-action.
- Be defensive or make excuses for missing features.

### Example Maker Comment Structure

```markdown
Hey ProductHunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], solo developer behind [Product Name]. I built this after struggling with [specific problem] for years as a [your role/background]. Every productivity app I tried either tracked my data or was too complex - I just wanted something simple and private.

**What [Product] does:**
- [Feature 1] - [Specific benefit, not just description]
- [Feature 2] - [Specific benefit]
- [Feature 3] - [Specific benefit]

**Why I built it differently:**
- **Privacy-first:** All your data stays on your device. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud sync (unless you opt in).
- **Simple by design:** No overwhelming features - just the essentials done really well.
- **One-time purchase:** No subscriptions, no upsells. Pay once, use forever.

I'd love your honest feedback, especially on:
- Is the onboarding clear enough?
- What features would make this a daily driver for you?
- Anything confusing or frustrating?

**ProductHunt exclusive:** Use code **PHLAUNCH** for 50% off (valid for 48 hours).

Thanks for checking it out! I'm here all day to answer questions and I read every comment. 🙏
```

### Tone & Voice

**For a Solo Developer / Indie Maker:**

- Personal, not corporate.
- Honest about limitations.
- Passionate about the problem you're solving.

**Phrases that Work:**
- "I built this because..."
- "I was frustrated with..."
- "As a [your background], I needed..."
- "I'd love your honest feedback..."

**Phrases to Avoid:**
- "We're revolutionizing..."
- "Game-changing AI-powered..."
- "The future of [category]..."
- "Disrupting the [industry]..."
- Anything that sounds like a VC pitch deck.

### Updating Your Maker Comment During the Day

**When to Add Updates:**

Add an "EDIT" to your comment if:
- You hit a major milestone (#5, #3, #1).
- You want to address a common question that keeps coming up.
- You want to share a particularly cool use case someone mentioned.
- You're extending your special offer.

**How to Format Updates:**

**Response Speed:**
- Aim to respond within 15 minutes during launch day.
- Set up notifications on your phone.

**Response Quality:**

For Simple Congrats:
- Heart/upvote the comment.
- Quick "Thanks!" or "Appreciate it!" is fine.
- Don't feel obligated to write a paragraph.

For Questions:
- Answer thoroughly and helpfully.
- Link to documentation if relevant.
- Offer to continue the conversation via DM or email.

For Feature Requests:
- Thank them for the idea.
- Explain if/why it's on your roadmap.
- Ask follow-up questions to understand their need better.

For Criticism:
- Stay professional and grateful.
- Acknowledge valid points.
- Explain your reasoning if there's a philosophical difference.
- Offer to continue the conversation privately if needed.

## 7. Media & Assets

### Thumbnail / Logo

**Specifications:**
- Size: 460 × 240 pixels (will display as 240×240 square in some contexts)
- Format: GIF, PNG, or JPG
- File size: Under 2-3 MB
- Optimize for a square crop (center of the image)

**Best Practices:**
- **Static Logo:** Simple, clean, recognizable. Works for most products.
- **Animated GIF:** Can make you stand out, but must be subtle and tasteful.
  - Avoid seizure-inducing flashing.
  - Keep animation simple: subtle movement, logo reveal, icon rotation.
  - Ensure it looks good when not animated (some users disable GIFs).

**GIF Thumbnail Ideas:**
- Show your product's value: Speed test going from slow to fast.
- Before/after: Messy workspace becoming organized.
- Product in action: Quick 2-second demo loop.
- Icon animation: Your logo subtly animating.
- Purpose-driven: For productivity app, a checkmark completing tasks.

**Tools:**
- Figma: Design static logos.
- Giphy Capture: Simple GIF recording.
- Gifski: High-quality video-to-GIF conversion.
- Screenhance: Turn screenshots into polished visuals.

**Warning:**
"Using a GIF thumbnail will tend to make your product stand out but not always in a good way." If your GIF is cheesy or distracting, it hurts more than it helps. When in doubt, go with a clean static logo.

### Gallery Screenshots

**Specifications:**
- Number: 4-8 screenshots (sweet spot is 5-6)
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (1000×600) or 5:3 if placing multiple side-by-side
- Format: PNG or JPG
- File size: Optimized for web (under 1 MB each)

**Best Practices:**

**1. Tell a Story:**
- Your screenshots should flow like a narrative.
- Order: Problem → Solution → Key Features → Results/Benefits
- Each screenshot should build on the previous one.

**2. Add Context:**
- Don't just show raw app screenshots.
- Add captions/annotations explaining what the user is looking at.
- Highlight key elements with subtle arrows or callouts.
- Show the benefit, not just the interface.

**3. Visual Polish:**
- Use device mockups (phone, laptop frames) to add context.
- Add subtle shadows and backgrounds to make screenshots pop.
- Maintain consistent styling across all screenshots.
- Ensure text is readable (high contrast, large enough fonts).

**4. Show, Don't Tell:**
- Instead of "Task Management" → Show a real task list with meaningful tasks.
- Instead of "Beautiful Design" → Show the actual beautiful interface.
- Instead of "Privacy-Focused" → Show settings with privacy toggles ON.

**Screenshot Flow Example (Productivity App):**

1. **Problem Screen:** "Overwhelmed by scattered tasks?" - Show messy todo list or calendar
2. **Solution Overview:** "One place for everything" - Show unified dashboard
3. **Key Feature 1:** "Quick capture in seconds" - Show quick-add interface
4. **Key Feature 2:** "Privacy-first design" - Show privacy settings, local storage
5. **Key Feature 3:** "Works offline" - Show app functioning without internet
6. **Results:** "Get more done, stress less" - Show completed tasks, clean overview

**Tools:**
- Screenhance: Polish screenshots with frames, shadows, backgrounds.
- Figma: Design mockups and add annotations.
- Hotpot.ai: ProductHunt Gallery Generator (templates).
- Cleanshot X: Mac screenshot tool with annotations.
- Screenshot.rocks: Wrap screenshots in device frames.

### Product Video / Demo

**Specifications:**
- Length: 30-60 seconds (absolute maximum: 2 minutes)
- Format: MP4, YouTube embed, or Vimeo
- Quality: 1080p minimum
- Sound: Optional (many users browse muted)

**Key Statistic:**
53% of products that reached Product of the Day since 2021 included a video.

**Best Practices:**

**1. First 5 Seconds are Critical:**
- Hook viewers immediately with the problem or a wow moment.
- Don't waste time on logos and intros.
- Example opening: "Spending hours in todo apps but still missing deadlines? Here's why..."

**2. Show, Don't Tell:**
- Demonstrate your product in action.
- Use real workflows, not generic placeholder content.
- Show actual valuable features, not just UI tour.

**3. Keep It Simple:**
- One main message: What does your product do and why should I care?
- No jargon, no technical explanations.
- Assume viewer has 5-second attention span.

**4. Add Text Overlays:**
- Many users browse muted.
- Add simple text highlighting key points.
- Use captions if there's narration.

**5. End with a CTA:**
- "Try it free" / "Get started" / "Learn more"
- Include your website URL.

**Video Structure (60 seconds):**

- 0-5s: Hook (problem statement or wow moment)
- 5-15s: What is it? (one-sentence explanation + quick visual)
- 15-45s: Key features (show 2-3 main features in action)
- 45-55s: Why it's different (privacy-first, simple, etc.)
- 55-60s: Call-to-action (Try it now)

**When to Skip Video:**

"Videos take a ton of time and/or money to do well and they ALWAYS show first so if a video isn't your best foot forward, don't waste your time."

Skip video if:
- You don't have budget for professional production.
- You can't record a clear demo that looks polished.
- Your product is better explained with screenshots + text.
- You're more comfortable with GIFs (easier to create, often just as effective).

**Low-Budget Video Options:**

For Solo Developers:
- **Loom:** Record yourself demoing the product with narration (free, easy).
- **Screen.Studio:** Polished screen recordings with automatic zooms and effects.
- **ScreenFlow / Camtasia:** Screen recording with basic editing.
- **iPhone + iMovie:** Record physical demo (for mobile apps) and edit simply.

**Pro Tip:** A simple Loom video with clear narration and real product demo beats a "professional" generic stock video every time. Authenticity > production value.

### ProductHunt-Specific Asset: First 3 Gallery Images

**Critical Optimization:**

The first 3 images in your gallery show in the preview thumbnail on the homepage. These are the MOST important images.

**Best Practice:**
- Image 1: Hero shot - product overview or key value prop
- Image 2: Main feature demo or before/after
- Image 3: Unique differentiator (privacy, offline, simplicity)

Don't bury your best screenshots at the end - lead with your strongest assets.

### Tagline (One-Sentence Description)

**Specifications:**
- Character limit: 60 characters
- Displays on homepage listings
- This is often the ONLY thing people read before deciding to click

**Formula:**

[Action Verb] + [What] + [For Whom] + [Unique Angle]

**Examples:**

Good:
- "Private task manager that works offline"
- "Distraction-free writing, no account needed"
- "Expense tracking without giving up your data"

Bad:
- "The future of productivity" (vague, meaningless)
- "AI-powered task management platform" (generic, no unique angle)
- "Revolutionary workflow optimization solution" (corporate speak)

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with your unique differentiator (privacy, simplicity, offline, etc.)
- Be specific, not aspirational.
- Use plain language, not marketing jargon.
- Answer: What is it, and why is it different?

### Description (Main Product Description)

**Specifications:**
- No hard character limit, but be concise
- Supports basic markdown formatting
- Shows on product page below gallery

**Structure:**

Paragraph 1: Problem + Solution (2-3 sentences)
> "[Product] is a [category] for [audience] who are frustrated with [problem]. Unlike [alternatives], [Product] is [unique approach] that [benefit]."

Paragraph 2: Key Features (bullet list)
> **Key Features:**
> - [Feature 1]: [Benefit]
> - [Feature 2]: [Benefit]
> - [Feature 3]: [Benefit]

Paragraph 3: Who It's For (1-2 sentences)
> "Perfect for [specific user type] who value [core values like privacy, simplicity, etc.]."

Paragraph 4: Technical Details (if relevant, 1 sentence)
> "Available on [platforms]. [Free / One-time purchase / Freemium]."

**Keep It Scannable:**
- Use bullet points.
- Bold important phrases.
- Add white space between sections.
- Max 150-200 words total.

## 8. Post-Launch Strategy

### Days 1-2: Immediate Follow-Up

**Launch Day Evening (After 24 hours):**
- Respond to any remaining comments (don't ghost the community).
- Take screenshots of your peak ranking, key metrics, best comments.
- Draft a thank-you post for social media.

**Day After Launch:**

1. **Thank Your Supporters (Social Media):**

Post on Twitter/LinkedIn:
> "We launched on ProductHunt yesterday and hit [#X Product of the Day / XX upvotes / amazing milestone]!
>
> Blown away by the support and feedback from the community. Special thanks to everyone who tried it, commented, and shared their thoughts.
>
> Here are the top 3 feature requests we heard: [list them]
>
> Already working on [one of them]. 🚀"

Include screenshots of your launch, comments, or metrics.

2. **Send Thank-You Email:**

To your email list:
> Subject: Thank you! Here's what happened...
>
> Yesterday we launched [Product] on ProductHunt and the response was incredible.
>
> We reached [#X Product of the Day] with [XX] upvotes and [YY] comments. More importantly, we had amazing conversations with [types of users] who shared [valuable insights].
>
> Top 3 things we learned:
> 1. [Insight]
> 2. [Insight]
> 3. [Insight]
>
> Based on your feedback, here's what we're prioritizing:
> - [Feature/improvement]
> - [Feature/improvement]
>
> If you haven't tried [Product] yet, here's your link: [URL]
> Use code PHLAUNCH for 50% off (extended through [date]).
>
> Thank you for being part of this journey!

3. **Continue Responding to Comments:**

ProductHunt discussions continue for days after launch. Keep engaging:
- Check your product page daily for new comments (for at least a week).
- Respond within 24 hours (doesn't need to be immediate anymore).
- Many users discover products through newsletters and weekly digests.

### Week 1: Leverage the Momentum

**1. Add ProductHunt Badge to Your Website:**

ProductHunt offers embeddable badges for products that launched. Add it to:
- Homepage (if you ranked well)
- About page
- Footer

**2. Repurpose Launch Content:**

Create follow-up content:
- **Blog post:** "What we learned launching on ProductHunt"
- **Twitter thread:** Behind-the-scenes of the launch
- **Case study:** "How we hit #X Product of the Day as a solo developer"
- **YouTube video:** Demo + launch story

**3. Reach Out to Users Who Signed Up:**

- Send onboarding email asking for feedback.
- Personally email 10-20 early users thanking them and asking about their experience.
- Ask permission to feature them as testimonials/case studies.

**4. Implement Quick Wins:**

If there were small feature requests that came up repeatedly:
- Prioritize 1-2 quick wins.
- Ship them within a week.
- Post an update on ProductHunt: "Thanks for the feedback! We just shipped [feature]."

### Week 2-4: Long-Term Value

**1. ProductHunt Newsletter Features:**

Products that performed well often get featured in:
- Daily newsletter
- Weekly newsletter
- Category-specific roundups

Continue to:
- Monitor traffic from PH (may spike again when featured).
- Keep your product page updated with new screenshots if you ship features.

**2. Leverage for Other Launches:**

ProductHunt success is social proof. Use it for:
- Press outreach: "We hit #X on ProductHunt with [stats]."
- Investor pitches (if applicable): Shows traction and community interest.
- Partnerships: Other companies take you more seriously.

**3. Analyze Results:**

Key metrics to track:
- **Upvotes & Comments:** Engagement level.
- **Website Traffic:** How much did PH drive?
- **Sign-ups / Downloads:** Conversion rate from PH traffic.
- **User Retention:** Are PH users actually using the product?
- **Qualitative Feedback:** What did you learn about your users?

Create a simple report:
```
ProductHunt Launch Results:
- Ranking: #X Product of the Day
- Upvotes: XXX
- Comments: XX
- Website visits: XXX (XX% from PH)
- Sign-ups: XXX (XX% conversion)
- Revenue (if applicable): $XXX
- Key learnings: [3-5 insights]
- Next steps: [based on feedback]
```

**4. Stay Engaged with the Community:**

Don't disappear after your launch. Continue to:
- Upvote products you find interesting.
- Leave thoughtful comments on other launches.
- Answer questions in discussions.
- Support other indie makers.

This builds long-term relationships and karma for your next launch.

### When to Re-Launch on ProductHunt

**ProductHunt's Official Policy:**
"You can launch as often as you have new significant product iterations available."

**When Re-Launching Makes Sense:**
- Major version release (2.0, 3.0)
- Significant new feature (AI integration, platform expansion)
- Complete redesign or pivot
- New platform launch (iOS app after web launch)

**How Long to Wait:**
- No hard rule, but 6-12 months is typical.
- Must have substantial changes (not just bug fixes).
- Submit a request explaining changes - PH team reviews and approves.

**Re-Launch Strategy:**
- Reference your previous launch: "We launched X months ago and heard your feedback. Here's v2.0 with [major changes]."
- Show how community feedback shaped the new version.
- Thank previous supporters and invite them back.

## 9. ProductHunt Algorithm

### How Ranking Works

**Official Stance:**
ProductHunt keeps the exact algorithm proprietary to prevent gaming. However, based on community knowledge and official hints, here are the key factors:

### Primary Ranking Factors

**1. Upvotes (Weighted)**

Not all upvotes are equal:
- **High-karma users:** Upvotes from established, active PH community members count MORE.
- **New accounts:** Upvotes from brand new accounts count LESS (or may trigger spam detection).
- **Inactive users:** Upvotes from users who haven't engaged in months count less.

**Formula (Approximate):**
Ranking Points = (Upvote Count × User Karma Weight) + Engagement Factors

This is why you can have 200 upvotes and rank higher than a product with 250 upvotes.

**2. Upvote Velocity**

How quickly upvotes accumulate matters:
- **First 3 hours:** Critical for momentum. Products that get 50+ upvotes in the first 3 hours often make front page.
- **Sustained growth:** Steady upvotes throughout the day rank better than early spike that dies off.
- **Late surge:** Hard to recover if you start slow - algorithm favors early momentum.

**Why timing at 12:01 AM matters:** Maximum time to build velocity and avoid dead zones.

**3. Engagement (Comments & Discussion)**

Comment volume and quality matter:
- Products with active discussions rank higher.
- Maker responsiveness boosts ranking (respond fast = boost).
- Quality discussions (back-and-forth, thoughtful questions) count more than "congrats!" spam.

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Total comment count
- Unique commenters (more valuable than one person commenting 10 times)
- Comment depth (replies to comments, threaded discussions)
- Maker response time (faster = better)

**4. Click-Through Rate (CTR)**

From homepage to product page:
- Strong thumbnail + tagline = higher CTR = ranking boost.
- Products with engaging visuals (GIFs) often get higher CTR.
- Users clicking through and spending time on page signals quality.

**5. Time on Page**

How long visitors spend on your product page:
- Visitors who read description, watch video, click through to website = strong signal.
- Bounce rate matters: Quick exits hurt ranking.
- Longer engagement = algorithm assumes quality product.

**6. External Traffic**

Traffic you drive from outside ProductHunt:
- Social media shares, email traffic, community posts.
- Shows you have an audience and marketing ability.
- BUT: Bringing in brand new accounts just to upvote may trigger spam detection.

### Secondary Factors

**7. Hunter Influence (Minor)**

- If you use a hunter with high karma, slight initial boost from their followers being notified.
- Data shows this is MUCH less important than people think (79% of featured products were self-hunted).

**8. Product Quality Signals**

- Complete profile (description, links, screenshots, video)
- Professional presentation (polished assets)
- Maker credibility (complete maker profile, active community member)

**9. Time Decay**

- Rankings reset at 12:01 AM PST daily.
- Products naturally decay throughout the day as new ones launch.
- To maintain position, you need sustained upvote flow.

### Anti-Gaming Measures

**ProductHunt Actively Detects and Penalizes:**

1. **Fake Upvotes:**
   - Bots, purchased upvotes, fake accounts.
   - Consequence: Upvotes removed, product de-ranked or delisted.

2. **Vote Rings:**
   - Groups coordinating to upvote each other's products.
   - PH detects patterns of reciprocal upvoting.
   - Consequence: All involved products penalized.

3. **Mass Messaging for Upvotes:**
   - Sending DMs asking people to upvote.
   - Triggers spam detection if reported.
   - Consequence: Product ranking suppressed.

4. **New Account Brigading:**
   - Bringing in tons of new PH accounts just to upvote your product.
   - Algorithm detects sudden influx of low-karma accounts.
   - Consequence: Those upvotes may count negatively or be removed.

**Red Flags That Trigger Algorithm Penalties:**
- Sudden spike of upvotes from new accounts
- Upvotes coming from same IP addresses
- Patterns of users who ONLY upvote one product (yours)
- Users who signed up minutes before upvoting
- Mass upvotes from users who never engage otherwise

### Hidden Upvotes (First 4 Hours)

**Recent Change:**
ProductHunt hides exact upvote counts for the first 4 hours of launch day. You'll see "XX+" instead of exact numbers.

**Why:**
- Reduces "bandwagon effect" of only upvoting what's already popular.
- Gives smaller products a chance to gain organic traction.
- Focuses early engagement on quality, not just upvote count.

**Impact:**
Early hours matter even MORE now - you can't rely on visible momentum to drive upvotes.

### Practical Implications for Solo Developers

**What You CAN Control:**

1. **Launch timing:** 12:01 AM PST on a weekend.
2. **Product quality:** Polished assets, complete description, working product.
3. **Maker engagement:** Respond to every comment quickly and thoughtfully.
4. **Authentic community:** Build genuine relationships before launch.
5. **Quality upvotes:** Focus on engaged users, not just quantity.

**What You CAN'T Control (Don't Waste Time):**

1. Gaming the algorithm - PH is sophisticated, you'll get caught.
2. Competing with VC-backed launches - you're in a different league.
3. Exact ranking formula - it's proprietary and changes regularly.

**Success Metric Mindset:**

Ranking is a vanity metric. Focus on:
- Quality of feedback received
- Users who actually signed up and engaged
- Validation of product-market fit
- Relationships built in the community

A #10 ranking with 150 engaged users who become advocates is better than #2 ranking with 500 drive-by upvotes who never use the product.

## 10. Case Studies

### Successful Indie App Launches

**Case Study 1: Balance (Personal Finance App)**

**Background:**
Solo developer, built in public, open beta on Twitter.

**Strategy:**
- Built audience from ~200 to ~700 Twitter followers during development.
- Posted regular updates showing progress.
- Created a Coming Soon page on ProductHunt that performed well.
- Focused on personal network + Twitter community.

**Results:**
- Top of ProductHunt for the day
- Social media was the primary driver (not PH hunter)

**Key Takeaway:**
"For the PH launch specifically, what helped the most was the success of the coming soon page post, with social media helping to get there."

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Build your audience BEFORE launch. Your existing followers are more valuable than finding a hunter.

---

**Case Study 2: Nitro (Translation Service)**

**Background:**
Small team, launched 3 times on ProductHunt.

**Strategy:**
- Self-hunted all three times (no external hunter).
- Focused on genuine community engagement.
- Each launch was a major product iteration.

**Results:**
- All 3 launches achieved top products of the day.
- Proved that hunters are NOT necessary for success.

**Key Takeaway:**
"They never enlisted the aid of hunters, proving that a successful launch is absolutely possible without their assistance."

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Don't waste time searching for the "perfect hunter." Self-hunting works if your product is solid and you've engaged with the community.

---

**Case Study 3: Customerly (Customer Service SaaS)**

**Background:**
SaaS product targeting customer service teams.

**Strategy:**
- Asked for COMMENTS, not upvotes: "We kindly asked for sincere comments on the page rather than upvotes, and it worked."
- Offered 50% discount code specifically for ProductHunt community.
- Focused on driving discussion, not just upvotes.

**Results:**
- Top 5 Product of the Day
- Many genuine comments and engagement
- Significant paid subscriptions from PH traffic

**Key Takeaway:**
The 50% discount was "a game changer" that brought people to subscribe immediately for paid plan.

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Offer a meaningful PH-exclusive discount. Focus on comments/discussion, not just upvotes - engagement drives ranking.

---

**Case Study 4: Othership (Breathwork App)**

**Background:**
Mobile app, small team.

**Strategy:**
- Woke up at 5 AM on launch day.
- CEO and team sent INDIVIDUAL messages (not mass email) to supporters.
- Personal, one-on-one outreach throughout the day.

**Results:**
- #1 Product of the Day

**Key Takeaway:**
"Brian from Othership and his CEO woke up at 5 AM on launch day and started messaging people individually rather than sending out a mass email. The hard work paid off as they got to the #1 spot."

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Personal outreach beats mass messaging. It's exhausting, but individual DMs show genuine care and drive better engagement.

---

**Case Study 5: Grist (Spreadsheet/Database Tool)**

**Background:**
Open-source project, community-focused.

**Strategy:**
- Soft-launched on AppSumo BEFORE ProductHunt.
- Used AppSumo as marketing investment to gather feedback and build evangelists.
- Fixed bugs and polished product based on early feedback.
- Launched on PH with existing happy users who became advocates.

**Results:**
- Top Product of the Week
- Strong community of advocates pre-launch

**Key Takeaway:**
"Using AppSumo as a soft launch before Product Hunt helped the team gather feedback, fix bugs, and prepare everything for the launch."

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Consider a soft launch (beta, early access, AppSumo) to build evangelists BEFORE your PH launch. These users are your strongest supporters.

---

**Case Study 6: Tony Dinh (Serial Indie Maker)**

**Background:**
@tony_dinh2 - "absolute legend in the indie scene."

**Strategy:**
- Consistent presence in indie maker community.
- Ships quality products regularly.
- Built reputation over multiple launches.
- Engages authentically, shares journey publicly.

**Results:**
- Multiple #1 Product of the Day wins
- "Can beat large corporations on ProductHunt"

**Key Takeaway:**
Long-term community presence and reputation matters more than one-time marketing blitzes.

**Lesson for Solo Devs:**
Play the long game. Each launch builds on the previous one. Reputation in the indie community is your biggest asset.

---

### Common Success Patterns

**Across all successful indie launches:**

1. **Built audience BEFORE launch:** Twitter, email list, beta users.
2. **Engaged authentically on PH:** Months before launch, not just launch day.
3. **Focused on community, not just rankings:** Asked for feedback, not just upvotes.
4. **Offered value to PH community:** Discounts, early access, genuine engagement.
5. **Personal touch:** Individual outreach, maker responding to every comment.
6. **Quality product:** Polished, working, solves real problem.
7. **Clear positioning:** Not trying to be everything to everyone.

**What DIDN'T matter:**
- Having a famous hunter
- Huge marketing budgets
- Massive email lists (even 500-1000 engaged followers is enough)
- Being a "big name" company

## 11. Common Mistakes

### Pre-Launch Mistakes

**1. Showing Up Only on Launch Day**

> "One of the biggest mistakes you can make is showing up on Product Hunt for the first time on your launch day. It's a dead giveaway."

**Why it's bad:** The community values authenticity. If you only engage when you need something, it's transparent and off-putting.

**Fix:** Engage on PH for 2-3 months before launch. Upvote, comment, participate genuinely.

---

**2. Launching Without an Audience**

> "One of the biggest mistakes startups make is launching without an audience. Product Hunt itself won't generate traffic for you! You need to bring your own supporters."

**Why it's bad:** PH amplifies what you bring, it doesn't create it from nothing. Without supporters, you'll launch to crickets.

**Fix:** Build email list, Twitter following, beta users BEFORE launch. Aim for at least 100-200 engaged people.

---

**3. Skipping the Prep Work**

> "The most common mistakes on Product Hunt are skipping the prep work and ignoring feedback."

**Why it's bad:** A last-minute, underdeveloped launch shows. Users can tell when you rushed.

**Fix:** Follow the timeline in this playbook. Prepare assets weeks in advance.

---

**4. Not Scheduling the Launch**

> "Not scheduling the launch for at least a month (so as to invite others to follow your launch) is an important step that many don't follow."

**Why it's bad:** You miss the opportunity to build followers who get notified when you launch.

**Fix:** If PH still offers Coming Soon pages, use them. Schedule 2-4 weeks ahead.

---

### Launch Day Mistakes

**5. Being in "Sales Mode"**

> "Always being in SALES MODE is a top mistake. Don't make the mistake of selling your product, convincing people to go and upvote your product, it's a turn-off for everyone."

**Why it's bad:** PH is a community, not an ad platform. Hard selling is transparent and unliked.

**Fix:** Be authentic. Ask for feedback, not upvotes. Engage genuinely with questions and comments.

---

**6. Asking for Upvotes Directly**

> "Please don't. People should upvote things they genuinely like or find interesting, not because they were peer pressured to do so."

**Why it's bad:** Violates PH rules. Can get your product penalized or delisted.

**Fix:** Ask people to "check it out" or "share feedback." Let upvotes come naturally.

---

**7. Launching at Bad Times**

> "Avoid the classic blunders like posting at odd hours when everyone's asleep."

> "If you want to get good results from the PH campaign then don't launch the product on Saturday or Sunday." [Note: This is debated - weekends can work well for indies]

**Why it's bad:** Launching at 6 PM PST gives you only 6 hours to build momentum before the day resets.

**Fix:** Launch at 12:01 AM PST for maximum time to accumulate upvotes.

---

**8. Not Responding to Comments**

> "Perhaps a common mistake people make is treating PH as just a launch platform. Don't show up on launch day and never turn back."

**Why it's bad:** PH factors response time into ranking. Ignoring comments kills your momentum and shows disrespect to the community.

**Fix:** Respond to EVERY comment within 15 minutes on launch day. Continue responding for days after.

---

**9. Bringing in New Users Just to Upvote**

> "Make sure you engage people who are already active on Product Hunt. Some teams got quite a bit of penalty for bringing in new users."

**Why it's bad:** Algorithm detects this and penalizes you. New account upvotes count less or may hurt ranking.

**Fix:** Focus on engaging existing PH community members. Quality over quantity.

---

### Product Mistakes

**10. Product Not Ready to Retain Users**

> "The biggest mistake is being ready for the release, but the product isn't prepared to retain users. Not being prepared to onboard and retain users is a big mistake."

**Why it's bad:** You get a traffic spike but users churn immediately. Waste of PH launch opportunity.

**Fix:** Before launching, ensure:
- Onboarding is smooth and clear.
- Core features work flawlessly.
- No critical bugs.
- Product delivers on the promise in your description.

---

**11. Poor Product-Market Fit for PH Audience**

> "Products that don't align with the interests of Product Hunt's community, which primarily consists of tech enthusiasts, developers, and startup founders, may not perform well."

**Why it's bad:** PH community has specific interests. A product for non-tech audiences may get little traction.

**Fix:** Ensure your product appeals to PH demographic: tech enthusiasts, makers, entrepreneurs, productivity-minded people.

---

### Post-Launch Mistakes

**12. Treating PH as One-Time Event**

> "A common mistake startups make is considering Product Hunt as a one-time event. Instead, use your launch as a stepping stone for continued growth."

**Why it's bad:** PH benefits extend far beyond launch day. You miss long-term opportunities.

**Fix:** Stay engaged. Add PH badge to site. Repurpose content. Continue community participation.

---

**13. Not Following Up with Users**

> "Keep the momentum moving forward by following up with those who used your product (either by responding to their comments or via email if you captured it)."

**Why it's bad:** You miss the chance to convert PH visitors into long-term users.

**Fix:** Email everyone who signed up. Ask for feedback. Show you're listening and improving.

---

**14. No Special Offer for PH Community**

> "It's common practice to offer an 'early-access' deal to Product Hunt visitors to thank them for trying out your product and sharing feedback. Not having anything to offer is a missed opportunity."

**Why it's bad:** PH community expects some kind of launch-day benefit. Without it, fewer conversions.

**Fix:** Offer 30-50% discount, lifetime deal, or extended free trial. Make it PH-exclusive.

---

### Team/Strategy Mistakes

**15. Not Having Whole Team Engaged**

> "ProductHunt launch is a teamwork thing. Making sure that all the makers in your team are signed up and engage as much as they can with the community is the key."

**Why it's bad:** Solo responses can't keep up with high comment volume. You burn out.

**Fix:** As solo dev, this doesn't apply directly. But consider: Can you recruit a co-founder, friend, or early user to help respond to comments during launch day?

---

**16. Obsessing Over Rankings Instead of Feedback**

**Why it's bad:** You miss valuable user insights focusing only on your ranking number.

**Fix:** Rankings are ego. User feedback, quality conversations, and actual user acquisition matter more. A #10 ranking with 100 engaged users beats #2 with 500 drive-by upvotes.

---

### Spam/Gaming Mistakes

**17. Buying Upvotes**

> "Buying upvotes doesn't work - upvote sellers may present fabricated evidence of effectiveness, but in most cases, launches are negatively impacted by having votes removed or even being unfeatured."

**Why it's bad:** PH detects purchased upvotes. Your product gets delisted or penalized.

**Fix:** Never, ever buy upvotes. Build genuine support.

---

**18. Vote-Swapping**

> "Vote-swapping seems like an inefficient use of time. Reaching out to people that are actually interested in you or your product seems like a much more efficient way to get support on Product Hunt."

**Why it's bad:** PH algorithm detects reciprocal voting patterns. Both products get penalized.

**Fix:** Support products you genuinely like. Don't coordinate quid-pro-quo upvoting.

### Your Optimal Strategy

**3 Months Before:**
- Engage on ProductHunt: Upvote, comment, participate (2-3 times per week).
- Build Twitter audience: Share your journey, post progress updates.
- Collect emails: Beta sign-ups, interested users.

**1 Month Before:**
- Create all assets: Screenshots, GIF, video (or skip video).
- Write maker comment draft.
- List 50-100 potential supporters and start personal outreach.

**1 Week Before:**
- Schedule launch for Saturday or Sunday, 12:01 AM PST.
- Final asset review, product bug testing.
- Prepare hour-by-hour launch day schedule.

**Launch Day:**
- Post at 12:01 AM PST.
- Respond to every comment within 15 minutes.
- Share on Twitter 6-8 times throughout day (different angles).
- Email your list mid-morning.
- Personal DMs to supporters throughout day.
- Goal: 150-250 upvotes, top 5-10 ranking.

**Post-Launch:**
- Thank everyone on social media.
- Respond to comments for next 7 days.
- Implement quick-win features from feedback.
- Repurpose content (blog post, case study).

**Realistic Expectations:**
- 150-250 upvotes (weekend launch, solo dev)
- Top 5-10 Product of the Day
- 1,000-3,000 website visits
- 100-300 sign-ups (depending on product)
- Valuable feedback from target users

**Success Defined:**
