**Two agents conducted parallel research:**
1. **Growth Agent** - Naming best practices, branding scores, testing methods

**Bottom Line:** Only **2 names** have clean availability. **Yarvi** is the recommended choice.

## The Winner: YARVI

### Why Yarvi Wins

**Branding (84% score):**
- Unique and memorable
- Consistent pronunciation globally ("YAR-vee")
- Works perfectly with voice assistants (Siri, Google, Alexa)
- Literary connection (Joe Abercrombie's "Half a King" - smart protagonist)
- Retains "arvi" sound from original "Jarvis"
- Modern, tech-forward feel

**Availability (Zero conflicts):**
- No apps on iOS or Android
- No trademark conflicts found
- No established companies using this name
- Clean social media landscape
- Domain likely available (.com, .app)

**ASO Advantages:**
- Unique = instant #1 ranking for brand searches
- Room for subtitle: "Yarvi: Life Dashboard & Planner" (32 chars)
- Zero competition in productivity space

### Yarvi Brand Positioning Ideas

- Tagline: "Your daily quest companion"
- Metaphor: Productivity as journey/adventure
- Target: 18-35 tech-forward users

---

## Backup: JAVI

### Why Javi Works

**Branding (64% score):**
- Extremely short (4 characters)
- Friendly, personable feel
- Easy to type and remember
- Strong in Spanish-speaking markets

**Availability (Low risk):**
- Only conflict: Javi Systems (IT infrastructure, India)
- Different market (B2B IT vs consumer productivity)
- Clean app stores

**Concerns:**
- Pronunciation varies (English "JAY-vee" vs Spanish "HAH-vee")
- Common Spanish nickname = search competition
- Social handles may need variations (@JaviApp)

### When to Choose Javi

- Hispanic market is a priority
- You want the absolute shortest name
- Friendly/personal brand positioning preferred

## Why Others Were Eliminated

### Critical (Do Not Use)
| Name | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Harvey** | Harvey AI = $8B legal AI company. Would be like naming your app "Slack" |

### High Risk (Avoid)
| Name | Conflict |
|------|----------|
| **Jarvi** | Jarvi.tech - recruitment ATS with 800+ customers in 20+ countries |
| **Harvee** | Active iOS app "Harvee: Stress Monitor & Coach" on App Store |
| **Havi** | HAVI - global supply chain company with 10K+ employees, active app |
| **Yarvis** | Yarvis - AI workplace assistant for Teams/Slack, domain taken |
| **Yavi** | Yavi.ai (No-Code AI Platform, Jan 2025) + Yavi enterprise messaging |
| **Harvis** | Harvis.work - healthcare management platform with AI features |

### Medium Risk (Caution)
| Name | Concern |
|------|---------|
| **Harve** | Too similar to Harvey ($8B brand) - SEO/branding confusion |
| **Harvi** | Harvi Academy (medical education), phonetically identical to Harvie (recruitment software) |
