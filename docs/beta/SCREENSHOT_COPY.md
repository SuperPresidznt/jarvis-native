# Screenshot Text Overlays Plan

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Prepared by:** Quinn (CMO Manager)
**Status:** Ready to use with final screenshots

---

## Overview

This document defines the exact text overlays, callouts, and positioning for each App Store screenshot. Based on ASO research (see `ASO_DEEP_DIVE_2025.md`), screenshot text is now indexed on iOS as of June 2025, making these overlays critical for both conversion AND discoverability.

**Key Principles:**
- First 3 screenshots are critical (most users don't scroll)
- Text should be readable at thumbnail size
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Use consistent typography and positioning
- Keep callouts to 3-5 words max

---

```

```

**Callout Bubbles (pointing to specific UI elements):**
- Tasks section: "Today's priorities"
- Habits section: "Track your streaks"
- Calendar preview: "Upcoming events"
- Finance widget: "Budget status"

**Bottom Tagline:**
```
One app. Everything organized.
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Show dashboard with data populated (not empty state)
- Ensure all 4 feature areas are visible

## Typography Guidelines

**Callout Bubbles:**
- Font: Medium weight, same family
- Size: Readable at thumbnail, but smaller than headline
- Color: Contrasting background (dark on light or light on dark)
- Style: Rounded rectangle with pointer

**Taglines:**
- Font: Regular or medium weight
- Size: Smaller than headline, larger than callouts
- Position: Bottom 10-15% of screenshot

## Device Frame Options

**iOS:**
- iPhone 15 Pro (or latest) for primary
- iPhone 15 Pro Max for 6.7" requirement
- Consider iPad if app supports it

**Android:**
- Pixel 8 Pro or similar flagship
- Generic phone frame also acceptable

**Frame Style:**

## Localization Notes

When localizing screenshots for other markets:

| Market | Language | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| US/UK | English | Base version |
| Germany | German | Different word order, may need shorter text |
| Japan | Japanese | Vertical text option for callouts |
| Spain/LATAM | Spanish | Check for regional variants |
| France | French | Longer text - keep headlines short |
| Brazil | Portuguese | PT-BR specifically |

**MVL (Minimum Viable Localization):** English, Spanish, German covers ~70% of revenue for most apps.
