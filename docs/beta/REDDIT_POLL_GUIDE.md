## Should You Hide Your App Idea?

### TL;DR Recommendation

**DON'T hide it.** Reveal that it's a productivity app. Here's why:

### Pros of Revealing (Recommended)

1. **Ideas are worthless without execution** - In 20+ years of startup IP work, only ONE startup failed because someone stole their IP. Dozens failed because they were too secretive and couldn't get proper feedback.

2. **Better quality feedback** - Context helps people give relevant name suggestions. "Which sounds better for a productivity app?" gets better responses than "Which name do you like?"

3. **Higher engagement rates** - People are more willing to help when they understand the purpose. Vague surveys feel spammy.

4. **Your real value is safe** - What matters is your execution, user research insights, and the "how" of your implementation - not the general idea of "productivity app."

5. **Stealth mode is for fighter jets, not startups** - Over-protecting your idea prevents critical validation and feedback.

### Cons of Hiding

1. **Lower response quality** - Without context, people vote based on sound preference alone, not fit-for-purpose
2. **Appears suspicious** - Vague surveys get lower response rates on Reddit
3. **Missed opportunities** - You lose the chance to validate interest in the category
4. **Biased results** - You might pick a name that sounds "cool" but doesn't match productivity vibes

### What to Actually Protect

- DON'T reveal your unique features or "how" you solve the problem
- DON'T share your specific insights from user research
- DO protect your data, algorithms, and implementation details
- DO keep your competitive advantage (the execution) private

### What Successful Companies Do

Most successful startups validate ideas publicly before launch. They share the general category (productivity, fitness, finance) but keep their unique approach private. Examples:
- Notion validated "productivity tool" publicly
- Superhuman tested "email client" openly
- Linear shared "project management" without revealing their workflow methodology

## Best Reddit Communities

### 1. r/SampleSize (PRIMARY - BEST OPTION)

**Status:** Dedicated survey subreddit, 245k members
**Poll Support:** YES - native Reddit polls + external survey links allowed
**Best For:** Maximum responses, any audience

#### Key Rules

**Title Format (REQUIRED):**
```
[Tag] Topic (Demographic)
```

**Tags (choose one):**
- `[Casual]` - Best for app name testing (highest response rates)
- `[Academic]` - School/research (use only if true)
- `[Marketing]` - Commercial purposes (lowest response rates)
- `[Results]` - Sharing survey results (boosts visibility)

**Demographics (required in title):**
- `(Everyone)` - Any age, any gender, any location
- `(18+)` - Adults only
- `(US)` - US residents only
- `(M/F)` - Specific genders
- Examples: `(18-35)`, `(Students)`, `(Tech Workers)`

**Additional Requirements:**
- Include estimated completion time if >2 minutes
- Use trusted survey platforms (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, Typeform)
- Can repost after 24 hours + off front page (add `[Repost]` to title)
- Add "Shares Results" flair to boost engagement

**What Works Best:**
- `[Casual]` posts get more responses than `[Academic]`
- `[Marketing]` gets least responses
- Weekend posts (Saturday 6am-3pm UTC / 2am-11am EST) perform best
- "Shares Results" flair significantly increases upvotes and responses

**What NOT to Do:**
- Interrupt users mid-task
- Ask >3 questions in Reddit poll
- Repost within 24 hours
- Use clickbait titles
- Spam multiple subreddits at once

---

### 2. r/startups (FEEDBACK THREAD ONLY)

**Status:** 2.1M members, very active
**Poll Support:** NO standalone posts - weekly Feedback Thread only
**Best For:** Startup-focused audience, founder feedback

#### Key Rules

- All surveys/polls MUST go in the weekly Feedback Thread (pinned post)
- NO standalone survey posts allowed (will be removed)
- Contribute to others' threads to increase your engagement
- Ask people to return the favor
- More startup-savvy audience than r/SampleSize

**Note:** Good for secondary validation after r/SampleSize, but limited reach compared to dedicated survey subreddit.

---

### 3. r/productivity (RULES UNCLEAR)

**Status:** Unknown member count
**Poll Support:** No specific rules found - CHECK SUBREDDIT DIRECTLY
**Best For:** Target audience feedback

**Before posting:**
1. Visit r/productivity directly
2. Check sidebar rules about surveys/polls
3. Review recent posts to see if polls are allowed
4. Message mods if unclear

**If allowed:** This is your BEST target audience since they're actual productivity app users.

---

### 4. Other Subreddits to Research

**Before posting to any of these, verify their survey/poll rules:**

- **r/apps** - Mobile app enthusiasts
- **r/androidapps** - Android users specifically
- **r/iOSapps** - iOS users specifically
- **r/AppIdeas** - App development community
- **r/Entrepreneur** - Business owners (your potential users)
- **r/GetStudying** - Students (major productivity app demographic)

**Action Required:** Check each subreddit's rules manually. Many ban surveys or require mod approval.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

### Maximizing Response Rates

1. **Timing Matters**
   - Post on Saturday 6am-3pm UTC (2am-11am EST) for highest engagement
   - Avoid Monday mornings (low Reddit traffic)
   - Don't post during major events/holidays

2. **Keep It Short**
   - 1-2 questions = highest completion rate
   - 3-5 questions = good balance of depth and completion
   - 6+ questions = expect 30-50% drop-off

3. **Promise Results**
   - "Will share results" increases responses by 40%+
   - Actually follow through - post results 48-72 hours later
   - Use "Shares Results" flair on r/SampleSize

4. **Use Clear Language**
   - Avoid jargon
   - No acronyms
   - Simple, direct questions
   - 8th-grade reading level max

5. **Reciprocity on r/startups**
   - Take other people's surveys in the Feedback Thread
   - Ask them to return the favor
   - Genuinely engage with their questions
   - Build goodwill in the community

### What NOT to Do

1. **Don't Spam**
   - Wait 24 hours between reposts on r/SampleSize
   - Don't post the same survey to 10 subreddits at once
   - Space out posts by 2-3 days if posting to multiple communities

2. **Don't Use Leading Questions**
   - Bad: "Which name sounds most professional and trustworthy?"
   - Good: "Which name sounds best to you?"

3. **Don't Make It About You**
   - Bad: "Help me choose a name for MY app"
   - Good: "Which name sounds better for a productivity app?"

4. **Don't Interrupt Users**
   - Keep surveys short
   - Don't require sign-in unless necessary
   - Mobile-friendly is essential

5. **Don't Forget Mobile Users**
   - 60%+ of Reddit traffic is mobile
   - Test your Google Form on mobile before posting
   - Keep questions short and tap-friendly

### Analyzing Results

**Look for:**
- Clear winner (>40% votes)
- Patterns in comments (what associations people have)
- Age group preferences (might differ by demo)
- Memorability scores (crucial for app names)
- Category fit ratings (must score 4+ on 5-point scale)

**Red Flags:**
- Split vote (no clear winner) = test more names or refine existing
- Low memorability = name too complex or forgettable
- Category fit <3.5 = name doesn't match productivity vibe
- "None of these" >20% = back to drawing board

**Next Steps After Survey:**
1. Share results on Reddit (builds karma and goodwill)
2. Take top 2 names to trademark availability check
3. Test winning name on target audience (r/productivity if allowed)
4. Make final decision within 48 hours of results
5. Move forward confidently - don't overthink it

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Response Volume Estimates

**r/SampleSize with Reddit poll:**
- First 24 hours: 50-200 responses (depends on upvotes)
- If front page: 300-500 responses
- Repost after 24h: +50-100 more

**r/SampleSize with Google Form:**
- First 24 hours: 30-100 responses (extra click reduces volume)
- Better quality feedback but fewer responses

**r/startups Feedback Thread:**
- 10-30 responses
- Higher quality (founder perspective)
- More detailed comments

### Timeline

- **Day 1:** Post to r/SampleSize (Saturday morning)
- **Day 2:** Post to r/startups Feedback Thread + repost to r/SampleSize if needed
- **Day 3:** Analyze results, share findings, make decision
- **Day 4:** Move forward with winner

### Success Metrics

**Minimum Success:**
- 100+ total responses
- Clear winner (>35% votes)
- Category fit score >3.5/5
- Memorability score >3.5/5

**Strong Success:**
- 200+ responses
- Dominant winner (>45% votes)
- Category fit >4/5
- Positive comment sentiment
- Multiple people say they'd download it

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My post got removed from r/SampleSize"

**Possible reasons:**
- Title format incorrect (missing tag or demographics)
- Reposted too soon (<24 hours)
- Survey link to untrusted platform
- Broke Reddit-wide rules (spam, self-promotion)

**Fix:** Check removal reason, correct issue, repost

---

### "I'm getting very few responses"

**Possible reasons:**
- Posted at wrong time (weekday morning)
- Title not engaging enough
- Didn't add "Shares Results" flair
- Survey too long (>3 minutes)
- Not enough Reddit karma (post isn't visible)

**Fix:**
- Repost Saturday morning with better title
- Add "Shares Results" flair
- Shorten survey to 1-2 questions
- Build karma by participating in other threads first

---

### "Results are split evenly - no clear winner"

**This is valuable data! Options:**

1. **Test the top 2 in a runoff survey** (smaller sample, just those two)
2. **Analyze demographic splits** (maybe one name wins with 18-24, another with 35+)
3. **Look at qualitative feedback** (comments might reveal winner)
4. **Consider combination names** (Javi + Harvi = Jarvi?)
5. **Go with founder gut feel** (data informed the choice, now decide)

**Don't:** Survey forever. Make a decision within a week max.

---

### "People are suggesting completely different names"

**This means:**
- Your options might not be strong enough
- You're getting valuable creative input
- The crowd sees something you missed

**Do:**
- Take top 3-5 suggestions seriously
- Quick trademark check on suggestions
- Consider running a second survey with: Original 4 + Top 3 suggestions
- Don't ignore the wisdom of crowds

**Don't:**
- Get defensive about your choices
- Dismiss suggestions without consideration
- Start an entirely new naming process (diminishing returns)

---

## Final Recommendations

### The Optimal Strategy

1. **Start with r/SampleSize - Version B (Specific)**
   - Use Reddit native poll for maximum responses
   - Clear title: `[Casual] Help name a productivity app - which sounds best? (Everyone)`
   - Post Saturday 6am-11am EST
   - Add "Shares Results" flair
   - Promise to share results within 48 hours

2. **After 24 Hours:**
   - Repost to r/SampleSize if fell off front page (add `[Repost]`)
   - Post in r/startups Feedback Thread
   - Engage with comments and reciprocate feedback

3. **After 48-72 Hours:**
   - Analyze results (aim for 100+ responses minimum)
   - Share results publicly on Reddit
   - Make final decision
   - Check trademark for winner
   - Move forward

### Why This Strategy Works

- Maximum response volume (Reddit native poll)
- Quality feedback (context provided)
- Target audience validation (startup founders)
- Builds goodwill (sharing results)
- Fast turnaround (decision in 3 days)
- Low risk (ideas aren't stolen, execution matters)
