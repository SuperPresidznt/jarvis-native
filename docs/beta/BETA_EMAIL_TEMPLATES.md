## Template 2: Feedback Request (Mid-Beta)

**When to send:** 5-7 days into beta period

**Subject Line Options:**
```
Option A: Quick question about [APP_NAME]
Option B: How's your first week with [APP_NAME]?
Option C: [FIRST_NAME], 2 quick questions
```

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST_NAME],

You've had [APP_NAME] for about a week now. Quick check-in:

TWO QUESTIONS:

1. Have you used the app in the last 3 days?
   - Yes, daily
   - Yes, a few times
   - Tried it once
   - Haven't had a chance yet

2. What's ONE thing that would make you use it more?

Just reply with your answers - doesn't need to be formal.

IF YOU HAVEN'T USED IT YET:

No pressure. But if something blocked you from trying it, I'd love to know what. That's valuable feedback too.

IF YOU'VE BEEN USING IT:

What's working? What's annoying? Any bugs I should prioritize?

RECENT UPDATES (v[X.X]):

- [Bug fix or improvement 1]
- [Bug fix or improvement 2]
- [New small feature if any]

Update should auto-download, or check TestFlight/Play Store manually.

Thanks for testing.

[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. Found a bug? Screenshot + "what you were doing when it happened" is all I need. Reply anytime.
```

## Template 3: Feedback Survey Request (End of Beta)

**When to send:** 2-3 days before beta ends

**Subject Line:**
```
[APP_NAME] Beta Survey (5 mins) - Your feedback matters
```

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST_NAME],

The [APP_NAME] beta ends in [X] days. Before we wrap up, I'd love your structured feedback.

QUICK SURVEY (5 minutes):

[SURVEY_LINK]

WHAT THE SURVEY COVERS:

- Overall experience rating
- Which features you used most
- What's missing
- Would you recommend it
- Bugs you encountered

YOUR FEEDBACK DIRECTLY IMPACTS:

- Which features get prioritized for v1.1
- What bugs get fixed before launch
- How I describe the app in the App Store
- Whether certain features get cut or improved

AS A THANK YOU:

Everyone who completes the survey gets:
- Name in the credits (if you want)
- Free lifetime premium access
- Early access to major updates

DEADLINE:

Please complete by [SURVEY_DEADLINE] so I can incorporate feedback before launch.

If you'd rather just reply with thoughts instead of filling out a form, that works too.

Thanks for being part of this.

[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. If you stopped using the app mid-beta, I'd especially appreciate knowing why. That's the most valuable feedback.

## Template 4: Launch Announcement

**When to send:** Launch day (or day before for "insider preview")

**Subject Line Options:**
```
Option A: [APP_NAME] is LIVE - Thank you
Option B: We launched! (And you helped make it happen)
Option C: [FIRST_NAME], [APP_NAME] just went live
```

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST_NAME],

It's official. [APP_NAME] is live on the App Store and Google Play.

DOWNLOAD LINKS:

iOS: [APP_STORE_LINK]
Android: [PLAY_STORE_LINK]

YOUR IMPACT:

Your beta feedback directly led to:
- [Specific fix/improvement from beta feedback]
- [Another change based on feedback]
- [Bug that got squashed]

The app is better because you took time to test it and tell me what sucked.

THE ASK:

If you're still using [APP_NAME] and finding it useful, would you mind leaving a review?

Early reviews have a massive impact on App Store visibility. Like, disproportionately massive in the first 48 hours.

Leave a review:
- iOS: [IOS_REVIEW_LINK]
- Android: [ANDROID_REVIEW_LINK]

If the app isn't for you, no hard feelings. I appreciate you giving it a shot.

WHAT'S NEXT:

Based on beta feedback, here's the roadmap:

Next 30 days:
- [Feature or fix 1]
- [Feature or fix 2]

Next 90 days:
- [Bigger feature]
- [Cloud sync or other major addition]

STAY IN THE LOOP:

I'll send occasional updates (monthly, max). Unsubscribe link is at the bottom if you'd rather not.

Thank you again. Launching is terrifying. Having people who actually used it and gave honest feedback made it less terrifying.

[YOUR_NAME]
[APP_NAME] Developer

1. **Subject lines:** Keep under 50 chars, personalize if possible
2. **Length:** Keep under 300 words for updates, allow longer for welcome
3. **CTAs:** One primary action per email
4. **Timing:** Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM recipient's timezone
5. **Reply-to:** Use a real email you check, not no-reply
6. **Mobile:** Test on mobile - most will read there
