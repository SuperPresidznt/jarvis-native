## Press Angles

### 1. Privacy-First Productivity
In an era of data harvesting, Javi takes the opposite approach. All user data stays on-device. No cloud sync means no data breaches, no targeted ads, no selling user information. Perfect for privacy-conscious professionals handling sensitive tasks and financial data.

### 2. All-in-One vs. App Fatigue
The average smartphone has 80+ apps. Javi consolidates five common productivity categories into one seamless experience. Less context switching, less subscription fatigue, more focus on what matters.

### 3. Indie Developer Story
[FOUNDER_NAME] built Javi as [INSERT PERSONAL STORY - why you built it, what problem you were solving, your background]. Unlike venture-backed apps racing for user data and growth metrics, Javi is built to solve a problem, not to maximize engagement.

### 4. Offline-First Design
Works without internet. No loading spinners waiting for cloud sync. Data is always accessible, always fast. Ideal for travel, poor connectivity areas, or users who simply want apps that don't depend on servers.
