## Industry Trends (2025)

### From Business of Apps Research:
> "AI Enhancements are shifting from smart scheduling to task prioritization, moving apps from passive tools into proactive assistants."

### From Lenny's Newsletter AI Survey:
> "AI is far from the novelty it was a year or two ago. It has clearly cemented a place as work and productivity infrastructure."

### The Real Concern (Fast Company):
> "When existing products are retooled to emphasize AI, the technology often feels bolted on. It's not just that it isn't dependably helpful; sometimes, it's an obstacle to progress."

**Key insight:** The problem isn't using "AI" in messaging. The problem is AI that feels bolted on vs native.

## Recommendations for Javi

### DO:
1. **Keep "AI" in taglines** - it's a selling point, not a liability
2. **Position AI as the differentiator** - "AI-powered productivity" vs "another task app"
3. **Emphasize proactive assistance** - AI that helps, not just stores data

### DON'T:
1. Don't hide the AI - competitors lead with it
2. Don't make AI feel bolted on - integrate naturally
3. Don't use generic "AI assistant" - be specific about what the AI does

### Suggested Tagline Options:
- "Your AI productivity companion" (current recommendation)
- "AI-powered life dashboard"
- "The AI assistant that actually helps you get things done"

### Why "offline-first + AI" isn't contradictory:
- Offline-first = data privacy, reliability, works anywhere
- AI = smart features when connected
- Message: "Your data stays private. AI makes it powerful."

## Correction to Copy Review

The copy review (`docs/beta/COPY_REVIEW.md`) recommended:
> Remove "AI" from tagline - sets wrong expectations for offline-first app

**This is incorrect.** The correct recommendation:
> KEEP "AI" in tagline. It's the selling point. Clarify that data stays local while AI features enhance the experience when online.
