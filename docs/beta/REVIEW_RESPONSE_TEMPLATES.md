## Common Issue-Specific Responses

### "App Crashed"
```
Sorry about the crash. This shouldn't happen. Would you mind emailing [SUPPORT_EMAIL] with: 1) What you were doing when it crashed, 2) Your device model and OS version? I'll prioritize a fix. Thanks for your patience.
```

### "Missing Feature [X]"
```
Thanks for the feedback. [FEATURE] is on my radar - several users have requested it. I'm working on it for [TIMEFRAME]. In the meantime, you might try [WORKAROUND IF EXISTS]. Appreciate your patience.
```

### "Too Complicated"
```
Sorry the app felt overwhelming. I'm working on improving onboarding. If you'd give it another try, I'd suggest starting with just [ONE FEATURE] - you can explore the rest later. Feel free to email [SUPPORT_EMAIL] if you want a quick walkthrough.
```

### "Subscription/Price Complaint"
```
I understand. The free version includes [FREE FEATURES]. Premium is optional for [PREMIUM FEATURES]. If you have thoughts on the pricing model, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing them at [SUPPORT_EMAIL].
```

### "Lost My Data"
```
This is concerning and I'm very sorry. Data is stored locally on your device, but this shouldn't happen unexpectedly. Please email [SUPPORT_EMAIL] immediately with details - I want to investigate and prevent this for others.
```

### "Battery Drain"
```
Thanks for reporting. Battery usage shouldn't be high - the app doesn't run in the background by default. Would you check Settings > Battery to see what [APP_NAME] shows? Email [SUPPORT_EMAIL] with a screenshot and I'll investigate.

## Response Principles

1. **Respond to every review** - Good and bad
2. **Be human** - You're a solo dev, not a corporation
3. **Never be defensive** - Even if the criticism is unfair
4. **Thank them first** - They took time to write
5. **Take it offline** - Direct to email for complex issues
6. **Be specific** - Reference what they said
7. **Offer next steps** - Don't leave them hanging
8. **Follow up** - If they email, actually respond

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT argue or get defensive
- Do NOT copy-paste the exact same response every time
- Do NOT ignore negative reviews
- Do NOT promise features with no intention of building
- Do NOT mention competitors by name
- Do NOT offer refunds in public responses (handle via email)
- Do NOT ask users to change their rating (violates guidelines)

---

## Response Workflow

1. **Check reviews daily** - Morning and evening
2. **Categorize**: 5-star (thank), 4-star (learn), 3-star (investigate), 1-2 star (prioritize)
3. **Draft response** - Use template as starting point, personalize
4. **Wait 5 minutes** - For negative reviews, don't respond angry
5. **Post response** - Keep under 500 characters when possible
6. **Log issue** - If bug or feature request, add to backlog
7. **Follow up** - If they email, respond within 24 hours
