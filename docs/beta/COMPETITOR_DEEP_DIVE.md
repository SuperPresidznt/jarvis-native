# Deep Competitor Analysis: Life OS & Personal Dashboard Space

**Date:** December 27, 2025
**Author:** Quinn (CMO Manager)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive competitor research beyond initial PMF analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This document expands on the competitive analysis in `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_PMF.md` with deeper research into the "Life OS" / personal dashboard / second brain space. These are competitors the human should study to understand market positioning, feature gaps, and opportunities.

**Key Finding:** The Life OS concept is growing rapidly, but implementations are either:
1. **Template-based** (Notion templates - requires assembly)
2. **Single-purpose** (finance OR habits OR tasks, never all three)
3. **Cloud-dependent** (no offline-first option)

Javi can be the first **mobile-native, offline-first Life OS** that works out of the box.
