---

### 2. JAVI (Second Choice)

---

### 3. HARVE (Third Choice)

- No direct "Harve" products exist
- Clean app stores
- Simple pronunciation

**Potential concerns:**

- ASO and SEO challenges

**Action items:**

- Consider if Harvey confusion is acceptable
- Verify domain availability

---

## Additional Considerations

### Domain Strategy
Since direct .com availability couldn't be verified via search:
- **Priority 1:** Check jarvi.com, javi.com, yarvi.com, yavi.com immediately
- **Priority 2:** Check .app and .io alternatives
- **Budget:** Premium domains may require negotiation or purchase

### Social Media Handle Strategy
- Reserve handles immediately upon name selection
- Consider variations: @[name], @[name]app, @get[name]
- Check TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook in addition to Twitter/Instagram

### Trademark Filing Strategy
- File USPTO application for top 2-3 choices
- Consider international protection (EU, UK, Canada, Australia)
- Use broad software/productivity category coverage

### SEO and ASO Implications
- **Yarvi** - Unique name = easier to rank, less competition
- **Javi** - More common = harder SEO, but easier to remember
- **Harve** - Harvey overlap = SEO challenges, confused searches

---

## Research Methodology

**Sources Used:**
- Domain registrar searches (Namecheap, ICANN Lookup, Instant Domain Search)
- iOS App Store searches for productivity apps
- Google Play Store searches for productivity apps
- Web searches for existing software products

**Limitations:**
- Domain availability requires direct registrar verification

   - File USPTO trademark application

3. **Before Launch:**

### Full Name Status (11 candidates):

| Name | Risk Level | Primary Conflict |
|------|------------|------------------|
